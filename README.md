# Learning Java
*Note*

1. You must compile your program before you can run it. Which means you compile by running ``` javac HelloWorld.java ```.
2. You should see no error messages. If that's the case then you can run your program with ``` java HelloWorld ````
3. If all went well you should see your program print in the terminal

### After every change to your class file, you have to rerun ``` javac ``` on your ``` .java ``` files. Then proceed with running the program
